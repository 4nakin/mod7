MOD7 
=============

It's a simple browser-based number game. It can be played [here] (http://zachschnell.com/mod7).

Rules and Instructions 
-------

*The player is presented with a 7 X 7 grid of numbers. 
*Clicking a number adds its value to the sum. If the sum is divisible by 7 (and is also not equal to 7), then the sum is added to your score. 
*If the sum is divisible by 3, then the game is over and your total score is your current score. 
*Each multiple of seven can only be used once each game. For instance a sum of 21 is added to your score once, but no subsequent time in that game.

I have yet to determine whether this game is too easy or too hard, though there are many directions for this game to go and shapes for it to take in the future. I am interested in experimenting with the numbers to include â€“ adding statements like 'numbers divisible by 5 subtract 20 points from your score.'
